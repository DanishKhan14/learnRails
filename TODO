Fault Tolerance:
----------------------
What does hadoop or spark do when a node fails ?
What does hadoop or spark do when a straggler is identified ?

Consistency:
-----------------
Try out different models of consistency:
Sync, Async, Bounded Delay, Batching, Estimated batching ?

Measurements:
--------------------
Time per epoch

Fix number of epochs: Vary batch size: bounded delay

Back of the envelop calculations for bandwidth requirements

Batch Size vs Required Bandwidth

Minimum mini-batch size used by a system so that it can converge to expected accuracy while observing speedup ?

Accuracy vs number of number of workers: Show that parameter server does not introduce accuracy loss 

Can we run using docker ?
